---------------------------------------
-Should user need to book ambulance? or system should assign the ambulance
itself, as user does not select which ambulance is better..
-Need of ambulance means it is emergency.

Next Steps :

-signup and login flow(UI, Backend).
-google maps api integration.
-booking flow(till booking notification).
-payment flow.
-user and driver chat interface.
-ambulance tracking with notification
-user reviews interface
-search hospital based on user inputs(like heart specialist, gastro, etc).
-search top hospitals category wise and based on reviews.
-real-time updation of beds, and doctors available and suggestion based on that
-records about no. of doctors, beds, ventilators, and other facilities.
-two modes of operation: emergency and normal.
-emergency mode will take care of everything, from searching to booking.
-while normal mode will give users options about hospitals and other stuffs.
